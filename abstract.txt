The aim of this paper is to give a basic introduction to Elliptic Curve Cryptography. I will begin by describing,very briefly, cryptographic goals and then proceed to discuss how elliptic curves have cryptographic usefullness. I would not refrain from using intricate mathematics if and when the need arises. Also an intuition would be provided as to why ECC works. Essentially the curves for which the discrete log problem is hard would be discussed. I will then introduce the problem of sending an encrypted message and discuss two encryption methods : Diffie­Hellman Key Exchange, and the Massey­Omura Encryption. I would summarise by pointing out the strengths of ECC by comparing it with RSA and other asymmetric encryption scheme and thereby,try to convince the reader that ECC is not a bad choice despite it being based on rigorous mathematical constructs. Despite the positives, ECC can be challenged by quantum computing, attacks similar to Diffie­Hellman attacks, theories of built-in backdoors and restrictions related to patents. This paper would be a serious effort to treat Elliptic Curve Cryptography in its entirety.
